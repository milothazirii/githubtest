**Checkers** is a classic board game for two players, where the objective is to capture or block your opponent's pieces. The game is played on an 8x8 board, and each player starts with 12 pieces that are positioned on the two rows closest to them. The pieces can move and capture the opponent's pieces, and players must try to control the board to gain the upper hand.

### Rules of the Game:

1. **Board**: The game is played on an 8x8 board, with only the dark squares used for playing (both players use different colored pieces).
   
2. **Pieces**: Each player has 12 pieces, placed on the first two rows of dark squares. One player uses red pieces, and the other uses black pieces.

3. **Movement**:
   - Pieces move diagonally forward, one square at a time, filling an empty dark square.
   - Pieces can only capture an opponent’s piece if there is an empty square immediately beyond it, in a diagonal direction.
   - Pieces can perform multiple captures in a single move if possible (called "skipping").

4. **Capturing Opponent’s Pieces**:
   - If a piece is diagonally ahead and the square directly after it is empty, an opponent's piece can be captured.
   - This is done by "skipping" over the opponent’s piece. Once captured, the opponent’s piece is removed from the board, and the player gains an advantage.
   - A piece can capture more than one opponent's piece in a series of moves, which is a key element of the game.

5. **Kinging**:
   - When a piece reaches the opponent’s back row (the furthest row from the player), it is "kinged."
   - A **king** has the advantage of being able to move both forward and backward, unlike regular pieces that can only move forward.

6. **Objective of the Game**:
   - **Capturing all of the opponent's pieces**: A player wins by capturing all of the opponent’s pieces.
   - **Blocking the opponent**: Alternatively, a player wins by blocking the opponent’s pieces, leaving them with no legal moves.

7. **Ending the Game**:
   - The game can end when a player captures all of the opponent’s pieces or when the opponent is blocked and cannot move.
   - Some variations of the game may allow for a draw if neither player can win.

### Structure of the Game:

- **Board**: 8x8 with dark and light squares (only dark squares are used for movement).
- **Pieces**: 12 for each player.
- **King**: A special piece that has more movement options, gained by reaching the back row of the opponent’s side.

### Variations:
- **International Checkers (Draughts)**: This version has different rules and uses a 10x10 board.
- **American Checkers**: A version using an 8x8 board with some small rule differences.

**Checkers** is a game that combines strategy and the ability to predict the opponent’s moves. It is widely popular around the world and has several versions with slight rule variations.
