      <h1>Checkers</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Checkers is played by two opponents on opposite sides of the game board. Black moves first, then players alternate turns. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.</p>
